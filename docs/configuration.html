      The behaviour of the <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> tools can
      be controlled with configuration files. This document describes
      the syntax and semantics of these files.

      <h1>Naming and Scope</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Naming</h2>
      <div>
	A configuration file must have one of the following names:
	<ul>
	  <li><tt>miss_hit.cfg</tt></li>
	  <li><tt>.miss_hit</tt></li>
	</ul>
	It is recommended to use <tt>miss_hit.cfg</tt>, except for the
	root directory of your project.
      </div>
      <div></div>

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <div>
	Configuration files apply to all files in the directory they
	are placed in (including any files in sub-directories).
      </div>
      <div>
	A configuration file in a sub-directory inherits all options
	valid in the parent directory, and then subsequently
	over-rides any options it wants to.
      </div>
      <div></div>

      <h2>Project Root</h2>
      <div>
	A project root is the basic configuration and is initially set
	to all default values.
      </div>
      <div>
	A project root is any directory that fulfils one or more of
	the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>Contains a directory named <tt>.git</tt></li>
	  <li>
	    Contains configuration file with the <tt>project_root</tt>
	    directive
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Was excluded by a <tt>exclude_dir</tt> directive
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
TERMINATED_DIRECTIVE ::= DIRECTIVE ( NEWLINE {NEWLINE} | END_OF_FILE )

DIRECTIVE ::= PROJECT_ROOT
            | GLOBAL_ENABLE
            | STYLE_APPLICATION
            | STYLE_CONFIGURATION
            | METRIC_LIMIT
            | DIALECT
            | EXCLUSION

CONFIG_FILE ::= { TERMINATED_DIRECTIVE }
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	A configuration contains comments (starting with <tt>#</tt>)
	and configuration directives. Each directive is terminated by
	one or more new lines (and you cannot continue lines).
      </div>
      <div>
	Configuration directives are processed sequentially. I.e. if
	two directives conflict, then the latest one takes precedence.
      </div>
      <div></div>

      <h2>Values</h2>
      <div>
	Directives often contain values, typeset in all-caps. This
	section defines the syntax for each value.
      </div>

      <h3>BOOLEAN</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>BOOLEAN ::= false | true | 0 | 1</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	Note the numeric form is here for backwards-compatibility. It
	is recommended to use the <tt>false</tt> and <tt>true</tt>
	literals instead.
      </div>

      <h3>STRING</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>STRING ::= &lt;double-quoted-string&gt;</pre>
      </div>

      <h3>INTEGER</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>STRING ::= &lt;non-negative-integer&gt;</pre>
      </div>


      <h2>Directives</h2>

      <h3>Project Root</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>PROJECT_ROOT ::= project_root</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive means we do not inherit configuration from our
	parent directory, but instead we start from a clean (default)
	slate. It is recommended to place this directive in the top
	level of your project.
      </div>

      <h3>Global enable/disable</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>GLOBAL_ENABLE ::= enable ':' BOOLEAN </pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive completely enables or disables all miss_hit
	tools. This is especially useful if you have a large legacy
	code-base that you're slowly transitioning. In this use-case
	you have <tt>enable: false</tt> in your project root, and
	individual components overwrite it again with <tt>enable:
	true</tt> on a case-by-case basis.
      </div>

      <h3>Style rule application</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
STYLE_APPLICATION ::= enable_rule ':' STRING
                    | suppress_rule ':' STRING
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive turns style rules on or off. The given string
	must refer to a <a href="style_checker.html">valid style
	rule</a>.
      </div>
      <div>
	Please note that any configuration associatd with a style rule
	is not affected by this directive. For example you can
	set <tt>line_length</tt> and then turn the corresponding rule
	on and off without having to re-specify the acceptable line
	length.
      </div>

      <h3>Style configuration application</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
STYLE_CONFIGURATION ::= IDENTIFIER ':' STRING
                      | IDENTIFIER ':' INTEGER
                      | IDENTIFIER ':' BOOLEAN
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive configures a particular style rule. The
	identifier must refer to a <a href="style_checker.html">valid
	rule parameter</a>.
      </div>

      <h3>Metric configuration</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar:
<pre>
METRIC_NAME ::= STRING
METRIC_OR_WC ::= METRIC_NAME | '*'
METRIC_LIMIT ::= metric METRIC_OR_WC ':' report
               | metric METRIC_OR_WC ':' ignore
               | metric METRIC_NAME  ':' limit INTEGER
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive configures a particular code metric. The metric
	name must refer to a <a href="metrics.html">valid code
	metric</a>. Using the wild-card means this directive applies
	to all metrics MISS_HIT supports.
      </div>
      <div>
	When <tt>report</tt> is specified, a metric is measured and
	included in the final report, but no limits are checked or
	enforced.
      </div>
      <div>
	When <tt>ignore</tt> is specified, a metric is not measured
	and not included in the final report. Use this to completely
	remove metrics you don't care about.
      </div>
      <div>
	When <tt>limit</tt> is specified, the measured metric must be
	less than or equal to the given number; otherwise a message is
	generated by mh_metric. (But these can be justified by special
	comments in the code, please refer to
	the <a href="metrics.html">mh_metric manual</a>.)
      </div>

      <h3>Language dialect</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>DIALECT ::= octave ':' BOOLEAN</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive controls which language is processed by
	MISS_HIT. By default we process MATLAB, but if this is set to
	true we instead process Octave.
      </div>
      <div>
	Please note that Octave support is limited right now, but I
	consider it a medium/long term priority.
      </div>

      <h3>Directory exclusion</h3>
      <div>
	Grammar: <pre>EXCLUSION ::= exclude_dir ':' STRING</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	This directive completely removes a directory from
	consideration, and makes them project roots.
      </div>
      <div>
	MISS_HIT will not enter such directories, unless explicitly
	demanded. For example, consider this directory structure:
<pre>
root
  / miss_hit.cfg (which excludes kitten)
  / potato
      / foo.m
      / bar.m
  / kitten
      / baz.m
</pre>
      </div>
      <div>
	Assume the user is in <tt>root</tt>.
	<pre>$ mh_style .</pre>
	This command will analyse two files, <tt>foo.m</tt> and <tt>bar.m</tt>.

	<pre>$ mh_style kitten/baz.m</pre>
	This command will analyse one
	file, <tt>baz.m</tt>. Furthermore, because <tt>kitten</tt> is
	considered a project root, any configuration
	from <tt>root</tt> is entirely ignored.
      </div>
