      <a href="index.html">MISS_HIT</a> includes a linter tool
      (<span class="file">mh_lint</span>). It is a classic
      bug-finding tool that focusses on code quality that is
      automatic, but not sound or complete.

      <div>
        This tool is extremely limited. What it does is helpful, but
        it doesn't do much and is <i>not</i> a replacement for
        e.g. <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mlint.html">mlint</a>
        or <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/checkcode.html">checkcode</a>.

      <h2>Classification</h2>
      <div>
        MISS_HIT Lint issues "check" messages for any potential
        problem it detects. These are further classified into three
        categories:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>low</b> - These are problems that MISS_HIT is somewhat
            unsure about if it is a problem or not, or problems that -
            if they manifest - are unlikely to be silently undetected
            bugs. Something that makes your entire program crash or
            obviously doesn't work is not as bad as something that
            quitely mis-behaves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>high</b> - These are problems that MISS_HIT very sure
            will cause major problems. Fix these!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>medium</b> - Anything else.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Checks</h2>

      <h3>Incomplete block comments</h3>
      <div>
        Block comments are special comments that span multiple
        lines. The documentation states that they must appear on their
        own line without any other text surrounding them, otherwise
        the behaviour is left undefined.

        MH Lint emits a check on all comments that may be block
        comments, for example:
<pre>
disp 1;
%{
disp 2; %{
disp 3;
%}
disp 4;
%}
disp 5;
</pre>
        The second block comment is not actually a block comment
        (creating the first warning). The third comment closes the
        first comment; but the last one does not close the second,
        since it's not a block comment (creating the second warning).

        The output of this code is 1, 4, 5 which is maybe not what you
        would expect.
      </div>

      <h3>Chaining relational operators</h3>
      <div>
        It is possible to chain operators, e.g. 1 + 2 + 3 which
        performs as expected. However it is also possible to chain
        relational operators, which does not work as expected:
      </div>

      <div>
<pre>
lower = 5;
upper = 20;
if lower &lt; var &lt; upper
   disp('var is in bounds');
else
   disp('error: var is not in bounds');
end
</pre>
      </div>

      <div>
        This condition always evaluates to true. Lets say var is
        100. Chained operators are evaluated left-to-right, lower &lt;
        var will evaluate to 1, which in turn means 1 &lt; upper is
        always true.
      </div>

      <div>
        MH Lint emits a check on all chained relations.
      </div>

      <h3>Shadowing of built-in functions ("builtin_shadow")</h3>
      <div>
        This rule attempts to find cases where we assign to a
        MATLAB&reg; builtin function (e.g. re-defining false to be
        1). Note: this rule works on a hand-curated list of "high
        impact" built-in functions, where it is likely this
        re-definition will result in confusion. So we complain
        e.g. about "true", but we do not complain about "bar".
